      <p>My name is Patrick. I write code. My wife and I currently live in Richmond, Virginia, which we moved to from Asheville, North Carolina. Spending most of my childhood without internet or computer access and then seeing it proliferate and become such an integral part of society gave me a deep interest in how the web works.</p>

      <p>I primarily use HTML and CSS, but have some experience with Javascript and Python. All of my experience has thus far been in the University of Richmond's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp program. I am driven, persistent, and adaptable to many different systems and frameworks.</p>

      <p>I am always up for a challenge, and I've yet to find a problem I couldn't Google my way out of. Reach out either through the contact form, or directly to my email right <a href="mailto: kuhlthing@gmail.com" style="color: teal">here</a>.</p>
