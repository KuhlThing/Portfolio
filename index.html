        <h1>Patrick McDowell</h1>

        <p>My name is Patrick. I write code. Spending most of my childhood without internet or computer access and then seeing it proliferate gave me a deep interest in how the web works. My wife and I currently live in Richmond, Virginia, which we moved to from Asheville, North Carolina.
            I am currently studying at a coding bootcamp at the University of Richmond. In my spare time, I play guitar and video games. My wife and I are also raising our two cats.
