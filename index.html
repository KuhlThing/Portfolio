      <img src="../../git/New folder/ProfilePic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Patrick McDowell">

      <p>My name is Patrick. I write code. My wife and I currently live in Richmond, Virginia, which we moved to from Asheville, North Carolina. Spending most of my childhood without internet or computer access and then seeing it proliferate and become such an integral part of society gave me a deep interest in how the web works.</p>

      <p>I primarily code in JavaScript, but have some experience with Python as well. All of my experience has thus far been in the University of Richmond's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp program. I am driven, persistent, and adaptable to many different systems and frameworks.</p>

      <p>The car is on fire, and there's no driver at the wheel, and the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides, and a dark wind blows. The government is corrupt, and we're on so many drugs with the radio on and the curtains drawn. We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine, and the machine is bleeding to death.</p>
